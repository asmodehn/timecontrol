"""A generally useful event scheduler class, asyncio version.

Each instance of this class manages its own queue.
No multi-threading is implied, however asynchronous scheduling is supported,
meaning that multiple scheduler in one event loop will synchronise things in the same event loop.

Each instance is parametrized with two functions, one that is
supposed to return the current time, one that is supposed to
implement a delay. Both of these can be asynchronous

Events are usual python's schedule events. see sched.py for reference.

        If blocking is True, keeps control via a while loop, just like the sync scheduler.
        By default it is non-blocking, returning as soon as waiting or call has been done.

        When there is a positive delay until the first event, the
        delay function is called and the event is left in the queue;
        otherwise, the event is removed from the queue and executed
        (its action function is called, passing it the argument).  If
        the delay function returns prematurely, it is simply
        restarted.

        It is legal for both the delay function and the action
        function to modify the queue or to raise an exception;
        exceptions are not caught but the scheduler's state remains
        well-defined so run() may be called again.
